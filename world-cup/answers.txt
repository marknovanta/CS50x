Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: Brazil winning was initially the highest probable winning, as increased the simulation, that wasn't the case anymore

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: once raised N to 100000, the predictions could've been already more valuable
